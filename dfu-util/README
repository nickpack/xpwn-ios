This is a heavily hacked version of the DFU-Util written for the OpenMoko
device, as made available here: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Dfu-util

Many thanks to the OpenMoko folks. Writing a USB DFU implementation from
scratch would not have been particularly fun.

From the wiki:

WARNING: Dfu-util is currently broken on big-endian architectures
